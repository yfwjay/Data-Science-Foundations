# Data Science Foundations (12 Weeks)

This repository documents my **12-week journey from beginner to confident** in Data Science.

It focuses on building **strong fundamentals** in:
- Python for data analysis
- Pandas & NumPy
- SQL for analytics
- Statistics & intuition
- Introductory Machine Learning

The goal of this repository is **learning, consistency, and clarity**, not polish.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Build a solid foundation in Data Science
- Practice working with real datasets
- Develop the habit of explaining my thinking
- Create a reference I can revisit later
- Prepare for deeper, applied projects in a separate repository

> Advanced projects, deployments, and capstones will live in a **separate repository** after this phase.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

- Hands-on notebooks over theory-heavy notes
- Simple explanations in my own words
- Small, consistent progress over perfection
- Frequent commits to document growth

Most notebooks are exploratory and may be messy — this is intentional and reflects real learning.

---

## 🧪 Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SQL
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebooks

---

## 🔗 Prior Learning

I completed a Python refresher before starting this repository.  
You can find it here:

## 🚀 What Comes Next

After completing this foundation phase, I will transition into a **project-focused marathon repository**, which will include:
- Real-world datasets
- End-to-end ML projects
- Deployments (Streamlit / APIs)
- Capstone work
